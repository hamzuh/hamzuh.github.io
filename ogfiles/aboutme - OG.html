               Good question! I have no idea anymore.
               This used to be a big paragraph talking about
               university and my interest in computer science
               but recently I've not really been quite sure
               about what I want in life. I can't really put
               it into words but I'm trying to make myself
               happy. I really want it to work out in the end.          
               <br><br>
               On a more literal and less apocalyptic note,
               I like to spend my time making, consuming or
               thinking about art. Drawing and music have always
               been big parts of my life, so I'll usually be
               working on music digitally or by practising guitar,
               and drawing in notebooks and Clip Studio, all of
               which I'd love for you to see and enjoy on this site.
               <br><br>
               I also enjoy gardening - which IS an art! - watching
               and discussing movies, playing videogames, cooking,
               building Gundam, collecting books, albums and magazines

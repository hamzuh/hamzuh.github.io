               I'm an enthusiastic and adaptable worker that’s keen to undertake any task or responsibility given to me. I strive to get any job done to a high standard and I can work well within a team setting. I take pride in helping others and providing a quality service all at the same time. This was copy-pasted from my CV so PLEASE DON'T LAUGH.
               <br><br>
               Making a website is good programming and design practice. Plus it will impress your grandma. I'm hoping to expand this site with more of my own work but also specific collections of things I have found useful or enriching in any way (PDFs, websites, etc.), so bookmark me if that sounds useful. My Linktree is in the contact section, it has a Google Drive if you want an idea of the stuff I'll be including. I'm also working on a mobile-friendly flex design and a general improvements list (more readable, less stolen fonts), if you have any ideas don't keep it to yourself.
               <br><br>
               In the meanwhile, if you need any help with art / coding resources, or you're interested in working together, feel free to contact me by email or Twitter DMs!

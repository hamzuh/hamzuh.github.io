I intend for this to be my main website! I'll do my level best to maintain it, for myself and for you.

##WHAT DO I WANT IT TO BE?

A place to put all the stuff I find interesting, so I can share it with the rest of the world. I want it to be an archive for all my creative work and thoughts while being a good exercise web-design-wise. It's also something I can stay involved in and keep my mind occupied with over time.

The original idea was for it to be two-sided, one for professional work and one for fun stuff. We'll see where it goes, but to begin I'll be setting up the general structure.

##WEBSITE STRUCTURE:

- splash page index with links to all bits at the top and bold design

- about me page with cv included as a link on my name

- contact dropdown menu to email me, has links to social media and linkedin and live tweet feed and SOUNDCLOUD !!

- my projects page to show pictures, short explanations and links to github

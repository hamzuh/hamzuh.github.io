I intend for this to be my main website! I'll do my level best to maintain it, for myself and for you.

It's a place to put all the stuff I find interesting, so I can share it with the rest of the world. It's an archive for all my creative work and thoughts while being a good exercise web-design-wise. It's also something I can stay involved in and keep my mind occupied with over time.

Feel free to poke around and inspect element if you find anything interesting. All code is written by me unless stated otherwise.
